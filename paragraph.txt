US film star Johnny Depp has returned to the international stage for the first time in three years appearing on the red carpet at the opening night of the Cannes Film Festival He signed autographs and took selfies with fans before the premiere of Jeanne du Barry in which he plays Louis XV alongside actress and director Maween  It is Depps first major role since a series of highprofile court battles with his exwife Amber Heard  The film received a standing ovation  Depp reportedly became emotional at the response but critics have been more lukewarm in their assessment of the movie   The Frenchlanguage film tells the story of a woman  played by Maween  born into poverty who becomes the French kings final mistress  But the decision to invite Depp to the festival has been controversial leading to the hashtag CannesYouNot trending on social media  He was dropped from the Fantastic Beasts franchise three years ago after losing a libel case with a newspaper which called him a wife beater  Last year he won a defamation case against Heard after she called herself a victim of abuse in the Washington Post  On Monday festival director Thierry Fremaux said he was not interested in Depps legal woes adding I am interested in Depp the actor Speaking at a press conference to promote the film Depp told journalists I dont feel boycotted by Hollywood I dont think about Hollywood I dont need Hollywood Steve Pond of The Wrap said the first night of Cannes saw a battle between a movie and a lot of stuff that didnt have much to do with the movie  And the movie Jeanne du Barry just wasnt strong enough to put up much of a fight Perhaps the film needed that controversy to be noticed he suggested It is a a movie that just isnt potent enough to grab any headlines on its own he said

by lead actor Maween  was shot at the Palace of Versailles with some costumes designed and created by Chanel  However despite being sumptuously made with jawdropping costumes it is also kind of bland according to Jordan Mintzer of The Hollywood Reporter  Even the casting  some would say stunt casting  of Johnny Depp as the king offers a few early thrills and then mostly yawns with Depp dishing out what feels like a total of a dozen lines in respectable French while otherwise remaining mute  His performance isnt bad and neither is Mawenns in the lead role But the two of them like the movie rarely get our pulse racing Damon Wise of Deadline also noted that Depps role is suspiciously light on dialogue but bewailed the lack of passion on screen  If Mawenns heroine really did sleep her way to the top and go to an early grave branded sin incarnate then Jeanne du Barry must surely be the PG version he wrote Awarding it three stars The Guardians Peter Bradshaw praised the watchability of the film and spectacular casting of Depp   But Louis and Jeanne are not entirely credible as a love story perhaps because of the cynicism in which they are both complicit and perhaps because the performances are a little opaque he continued Its an entertaining spectacle only partly aware of its own vanity Varietys Peter Debruge said the decision to cast Depp felt apt for there must be a palpable power differential between Louis and his latest infatuation  For his part Depp delivers his lines in wellturned French wearing fine powder and a stiff white wig and yet he seems strangely uncomfortable in the role  adequate but not especially engaged he added  Depps the kind of player who delivers practically every performance with a wink so its odd that even when his Louis is actually supposed to be winking at Jeanne the sparkle isnt there That curious lack of complicity saps the chemistry we crave between the two leads  However Rafaela Sales Ross of the Playlist described Depp as very American very misplaced in the film where his French accent is almost as distracting as his distorted makeup  If it wasnt for the highlypublicised scandals that envelop Jeanne du Barry it is likely the film would make a swift turn from the red carpet into ostracism and while the hubbub certainly delays the process it will do little to prevent Mawenns dire latest from the merciless hands of oblivion she added There was more sympathy from Kevin Maher in the Times who said Mawenn coaxed an impressively controlled performance from Depp  but the movie is not really about him anyway  Its very occasionally too tasteful for is own good he added But its also mature and grounded and represents probably the best recovery vehicle that Depp is going to get And Nicholas Barber of BBC Culture concluded The combination of Depp and Maween may have seemed like a dangerous one but on this occasion theyre playing it safe  Indiana Jones and other Cannes highlights Ten moments that defined the
